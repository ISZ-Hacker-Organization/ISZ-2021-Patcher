# FAQs:
***Why does this need an internet connection?***

- *If we included everything needed to patch the game, it could take upwards of a 100mb compiled* **.exe file, which is bloated, and not needed*.

***Why doesn't the Application Install anything?***

- *It can be a dozen of different reasons, all of which are hard to pin-point. One of the most common resolutions to this problem is: making sure you have Permissions.*
